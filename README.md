# Collection of Zettelkasten slips

Initially this repo will be manually filled with daily notes.
The notes will contain train of thought or things I've performed, in order to better recall things through documentation.

With this way of collecting notes I hope to accomplish the following:


* Minimal simplistic documentation, with a set standard that scales well with potential future automation scripts.
* Work more structured by typing out my train of thought.
* Perform retrospectives in an easier way.
* Memorize concepts or commands better.
* Capture potential future ideas before they are lost.


As of *2022-01-25* the notes will be pushed manually until automation.

## Current ideas to explore

* Write python script to make searching of old slips a breeze.
* Bake a markdown friendly plugin into vim e.g. [Pandoc](https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc), in order to better directly visualize notes being written.
* Automate the note creation process in regards to git add, commit and push, design TBD.
* Being able to add certain notes to [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), by adding a certain tag or marker in note. Depending on their API it might be a daunting task.
