## Lists

There are many ways of making a list in md.

```markdown
* bullet1
* bullet2
* bullet3

For ordered lists, use only a 1. This makes it flexible upon rearranging.

```markdown
1. This.
1. is.
1. a.
1. NUMBERED.
1. ORDERED.
1. *list*.
```


## Separators

To create a separator, use 4 dashes. It breaks up a page with a line.

```markdown
----
```


## Hard Returns

With hard returns, you start a new line within a paragraph; double space at end:

```markdown
At the end of a line,  
There was too spaces,  
Causing a hard break.
```

## Blocks

Blocks separates text or code from a document as a box. Two main types: plain and code fence.

### Plain type:

~~~markdown
```
    This is in a box.
```
~~~

```
   This is not in a box?
```


### Code fence type:

~~~markdown
```sh
for i in $(echo "shell-colored things")
  do echo $i
done
```

~~~

If you need to have md in your block (or md in your md in your block) use three or four tilde characters.

~~~~~
~~~markdown
This is in markdown.

```js
console.log('This is md in md')
```
~~~
~~~~

## Tables

Do not use tables in MD. If you need tables, use the one in *Pandoc Markdown*.
