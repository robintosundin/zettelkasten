# The Bash environment

## Default auto initialization

Interactively invoked, bash reads from `/etc/profile` to set syswide config. Syswide app config is commonly defined within `/etc/profile.d`.
Since `/etc/profile` is read syswide to all shells, it is more common to set syswide config specific to bash shell in `/etc/bashrc`.

## Variables

Bash keeps two types of variables: global and local. 

Apart from scope, there are 4 different types of a variable:

* String
* Integer
* Constant
* Array

By convention, global variables tend to be capitalized.

### Global variables

Available in all shells, can be viewed by executing `env`.

### Local variables

Only avaiable in the current shell. Viewed executing `set`; also displaying all the methods.

Most shell scripts execute in a private env. Child processes do not inherit vars unless exported by parent shell. Variables exported are called environment variables.

### Special reserved variables

There are several variables reserved by bash, a few of them are useful, e.g. RANDOM. Which generates a random int from 0 to 32767, seeded by setting.
Apart from variables, there are many special parameters of which some are especially useful:
* `$@` expands positional parameters, starting from one. When expansion within quotes each parameter expands to separate words.
* `$#` the amount of positional parameters provided.
* `$?` expands the exit status of most recently executed foreground pipeline.
