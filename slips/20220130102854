# Writing and debugging scripts

First line (#!/path/to/binary) denotes the binary used to interpret contents, most commonly a shell or other interpreter like python.
In the head of a script, it is useful to set shell parameters with set. 

## Some useful flags for set command

To get full list of opt exec `set --help` of the shell utilized for the script.

```markdown
- `-e`, exits the script if a command contained does not execute properly (non-zero exit code).
- `-f`, disable file name generation (globbing).
- `-x`, prints contained commands and their arguments as interpreted (useful for debugging).
- `-u`, treat unset variables as errors -- powerful together with `-e`.
- `-v`, print input lines as they're read by a shell.
```

To run a script within the current shell -- source it. Script interaction will carry over onto the current shell.

## Debugging

To debug a whole script, it is possible to run `bash -x script`; for a portion, use `set -x; *portion-to-be-debugged*; set +x`.
