# Discord forces update

When Discord releases a new update, they force the user to update. Until an RPM is packaged (discord only supplies a Ubuntu one) use a local installation.

In order to accomplish local install, it is possible to convert the deb package into an rpm with alien tool.

```bash
sudo alien --scripts -r -v -g discord.deb
sudo sed -i 's#%dir "/"##' discord/discord.spec
sudo sed -i 's#%dir "/usr/bin/"##' discord/discord.spec
sudo rpmbuild --target=x86_64 --buildroot ~/Downloads/discord -bb discord.spec
```

Then simply install the local rpm with `sudo dnf install discord.rpm`.

Side-note: one could use `sed -i 's/%dir "\/"//'` instead of the way above but with hash as delimiter it's not forced to escape slash.
