# sed stream editor

Short for "Stream EDitor", sed manipulate files or pipes with the result sent to stdout. This makes it natural in scripts and commands.

## Editing commands

Editing commands are similar to vi:

* a\ - Append text below current line
* c\ - Change text in current line with new text
* d  - Delete text
* i\ - Insert text above current line
* p  - Print text
* r  - Read a file
* s  - Search and replace text
* w  - Write to a file

Options:

* -e SCRIPT       - Add commands (SCRIPT) to be ran while processing input
* -f SCRIPT-FILE  - Add a file with commands to be ran while processing input
* -n              - Silent mode
* -i              - Edit *files* in place
* -E              - Use extended regexp in script

Ranges of lines can be invoked with `sed '2,4d' example`. Range cursors can be many things, e.g. matches on a line or metacharacters:

```markdown
sed -n '/a/,/b/p' example.
sed -n '/a/,$p' example.
```

Indentation and new lines can be added with \n, for example: `sed -i '/manpath/i\0\n    4\n        8\n    4\n0' b.tmp` which edits b.tmp in place, adding an indented "triangle" above matched line.
