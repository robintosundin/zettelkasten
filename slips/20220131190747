# Some notes about regexp

A regular expression is a pattern, describing a set of strings. Through the use of metacharacters it is possible to manipulate the set of strings, allowing powerful string matching in several applications.

## The list of metacharacters
* .     Matches any single character
* ?     Preceding item is optional and matched once or not at all
* *     Preceding item matched 0 times or more
* +     Preceding item matched 1 times or more
* {N}   Preceding item matched N times # e.g. 'e{2}' will match keep
* {N,}  Preceding item matched N times or more
* {N,M} Preceding item is matched N times up until M
* -     Represents a range if not first/last or ending point in a list
* ^     Matches empty string at start of a line; represents characters *not* in list
* $     Matches empty string at end of a line
* \b    Matches empty string at edge of word
* \B    Matches empty string at provided not at edge of a word
* \<    Matches empty string at beginning of a word
* \>    Matches empty string at end of a word

## Compatibility note

Bash only supports basic or extended regexp. Usually regexps from e.g. [regex101](https://regex101.com/) is formatted as PCRE (Perl Compatible Reg Exp).
